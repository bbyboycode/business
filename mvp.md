# Improving Traffic Conditions Around NYC

The goal of this project is to analyze New York City traffic data prior to the pandemic (2018 - 2019) and comparing it to post-pandmeic times (2020-2021). Recent findings have shown that traffic accidents in NYC have increased since the pandemic started. I wanted to use insights and findings drawn from my analysis to help the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) decide which areas around the city that they should focus their efforts on in order to reduce the number of traffic accidents.

I first wanted to verify whether or not traffic accidents actaully increased after the pandemic started.

I then wanted to see the YOY change of accidents involving injuries or death.

It's important to note that the data from 2021 only includes the months from Januuary to the end of September since 2021 has not conlcluded yet. So I'm expecting to see 2021 end with an even higher number of traffic accidents than 2020.

Then I wanted to see which boroughs made up the majority of traffic accidents.

I found that Manhattan had the most dramatic decrease in traffic incidents. This can be attributed to the fact that a large chunk of traffic accidents in Manhattan involves cyclists (food delivery personnel) and since many offices were closed and people moved out of the city when the pandemic started, the volume of food delvieries went down drastically.

I then used Tableau to get a geographic visualization of which parts of each borough had a large jump in the amount of traffic accidents and found that a large swaths of Brooklyn and the Bronx were responsible for the large increases in traffic accidents.
