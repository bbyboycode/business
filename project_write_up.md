Stanley Guo

## Abstract
The goal of this project was to analyze four years of NYC traffic data, two years prior to the pandemic (2018 - 2019) and two year after the pandemic started (2020 - 2021), to see how the pandemic changed the NYC traffic landscape, in addition to assisting the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) with their traffic initiave, Vision Zero, which aims to bring down the total number of traffic related deaths down to 0 by 2024.

## Design
The project was designed with the goal of gathering a top-level view of where exactly around the city are traffic accidents occuring, and whether or not these accidents involved any fatalities or injuries.
